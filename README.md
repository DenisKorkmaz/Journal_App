# Journal App

This project is a journal app created during my bootcamp, following the instructions provided in the [React Project Setup](https://github.com/neuefische/web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/react-project-setup/journal-app) exercise.

The Journal App is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage journal entries. Users can add new entries, mark entries as favorites, search for specific entries, and delete entries. The app is built using React, utilizing various React concepts such as state management, component composition, and local storage.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the Journal App [here](https://journal-app-a9ya.vercel.app/).

## Features

The Journal App includes the following features:

- Create new journal entries by providing a motto and additional notes.
- Mark entries as favorites to easily access them later.
- Search for entries by entering keywords.
- Delete entries that are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

The Journal App is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components and provides efficient UI updates.
- **useState**: A React hook function used to manage state variables in functional components.
- **useLocalStorageState**: A custom hook function that persists state in the browser's local storage.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are used to define the styling of the app.
